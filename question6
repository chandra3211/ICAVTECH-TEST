Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. 

To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing line changes, you must choose which changes to incorporate from the different branches in a new commit.

Once we find line of a file then Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> and make the changes you want in the final merge.
