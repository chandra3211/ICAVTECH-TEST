Q2.What are the benefits of having Policy management?

1 – Easily update policy forms and contracts
With policy management software, it is easier than ever to easily update organization forms and staff or vendor contracts. Whenever changes to certain policies or company agreements occur, they can be updated virtually and shared simply across different departments. 
2 – Manage Risk Across Your Organization
In order to more effectively manage risk across your organization, policy and document automation should be considered. Document management software allows your team to hold staff accountable for reading updated forms, policies and employee contracts. It is easier than ever to run reports and see detailed revision history on all approvals and read acknowledgments.
3 – Automate The Workflow & Save Time
By using policy management software, it is simpler to automate the interoffice workflow and save time on a number of key tasks. Whether you are creating, editing, or reviewing policies, you can do so in one location and automatically update connected parties. 
4 – Exportable Audit-Ready Reports
Your organization can now easily access exportable, audit-ready reports that include all of the documentation needed to demonstrate policy compliance. Feel confident knowing that you can provide a report that is ready to go and fully optimized with all of the relevant information your organization needs in the event of an audit or in a compliance case.
5 – Maintain Staff Accountability
With tracking capabilities, it is easier to see where changes were made and who the last user was that made those changes. This ensures that employee accountability is upheld and that staff receives sufficient training where needed.
